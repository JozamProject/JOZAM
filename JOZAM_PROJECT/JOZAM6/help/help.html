	<h2>User Manual</h2>
	<h3>Notice</h3>
		<p>	The JOZAM task manager is a local lightweight software that does not require an internet connection. It can be loaded on any web browser and on both operating systems WINDOWS and UNIX.

				<ul>
				<li>Basic task management ( create or delete a task, every task has a name, a deadline, a description, etc…)</li> 
				<li>Each task can be divided into subtasks </li>
				<li>Calculating the number of workdays left, by calendar integration</li>
				<li>Display with folding / folding out options</li>
				</ul>
